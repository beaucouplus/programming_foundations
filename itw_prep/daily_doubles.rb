# Write a method that takes a string argument and returns a new string that

# You may not use String#squeeze
# or String#squeeze!.

# i need to ğŸ”…split the string into characters
# i also need to create an ğŸ”…empty string
# i need to ğŸ”…iterate over characters and add them one by one to the new string
# if the ğŸ”…last character of the new string is ğŸ”…equal to the ğŸ”…current char,
# i don't push it
# else i push
# finally, i return the new string
