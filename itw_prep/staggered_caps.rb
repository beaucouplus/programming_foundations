# Write a method that takes a String as an argument, and returns a new String
# that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization scheme in
# which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining characters are
# lowercase. Characters that are not letters should not be changed, but count as
# characters when switching between upper and lowercase.

# every character with an odd index should be changed
# i need to get ðŸ”…chars from the string
# i need to iterate on these chars, with ðŸ”…index > it will be a ðŸ”…map
# if the index is ðŸ”…even, apply ðŸ”…upcase to the letter

def staggered_case(string)
  string.chars.map.with_index { |letter, idx| idx.odd? ? letter.downcase : letter.upcase }.join
